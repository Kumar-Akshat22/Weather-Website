## Lessons Learned

- Building this project was exciting as well as challenging for me.
- My JavaScript learnings were improved a lot.
- I got to learn about how to fetch Data from an API and convert the response into JSON format to extract data from it.
- The UI of the project is completely dynamic where the data is displayed using JavaScript.
- There are a couple of Event Listeners added in the website especially in the search icon to handle it's behaviour when it's clicked.
